### 👋 Hi there, I'm Margaret Johnson

I'm a self-driven tech learner building real-world experience in IT Support, Cybersecurity, and Data Analytics. I’m blending over a decade of professional experience in management and administration with hands-on labs and certifications from Google, Coursera, and DataCamp.

🔧 Currently working on:
- IT Support Labs (Active Directory, Backup & Recovery, Windows Server)
- Data Projects (Fraud Detection, NJ COVID-19 Analysis)
- AWS Cloud Foundations and CLI Labs

🎯 My goal is to support mission-driven organizations by solving problems through technology, data, and security — while continuing to grow and give back.
